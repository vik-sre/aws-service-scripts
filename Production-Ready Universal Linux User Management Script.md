Hereâ€™s a **comprehensive Linux user management script** that handles common tasks like creating, modifying, deleting, and managing user privileges in a **single script**. It includes safeguards, logging, and clear instructions for production use. This script ensures no important aspect of user management is missed.

### **Script Features**
1. **Multi-Functional**: Supports user creation, modification, deletion, granting/revoking sudo privileges, and listing all system users.
2. **Error Handling**: Validates input and ensures actions only proceed if conditions are met (e.g., user existence, empty directories).
3. **Logging**: Provides timestamped logs for all actions (INFO, ERROR, SUCCESS, WARNING).
4. **Interactive Menu**: A user-friendly menu system for performing different operations.
5. **Safeguards**:
   - Checks if the script is run as root.
   - Confirms before deleting a user whose home directory is not empty.
   - Aborts if critical details (like username) are missing.

---

### **Steps to Use**
1. Save the script as `user_management.sh`.
2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x user_management.sh
   ```
3. Run the script with sudo:
   ```bash
   sudo ./user_management.sh
   ```

---

### **Enhancements You Can Add**
- **Logging to a File**: Redirect logs to `/var/log/user_management.log` for permanent records.
- **Validation for Reserved Users**: Prevent accidental modification of critical system users (e.g., `root`).
- **Email Notifications**: Send email alerts for changes to users (optional, using `mail` or similar tools).
